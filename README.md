There are 256 rules to choose from.
~~The rules are triplets in format: 
"cell ON/OFF, cell ON/OFF, cell ON/OFF"
The rules can be of integer or array type~~.
Currently only integer format is supported (from 0 to 255)

You can decide which first generation cells are on or off.

You can visualize a single rule or all of them by making "slideshow" variable True.
